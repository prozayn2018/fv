Stockvalue is an app to help fundamental investors gain an insight into what a fairvalue price for a particular stock in the S&P 500 is. The fairvalue price is a pricing model that I have developed (to my best of knowledge) using Warren Buffett's very own model for accounting for a stock's fairvalue vs what is its current trading price in the market. 

App features:

* Fundamental data for companies in the S&P 500. 

* Graph to see the historical price of a stock. 

* Add a stock to a watchlist 

* Search functionality
